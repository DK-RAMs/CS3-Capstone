First confirmed case of Covid-19 in town!

The patient is a 38-year-old male who travelled to Italy with his wife. They were part of a group of 10 people and they arrived back in town last week.

The patient consulted a private general practitioner, with symptoms of fever, headache, malaise, a sore throat and a cough. Swabs were taken and delivered to the lab.

The patient has been self-isolating for the last 3 days. The couple also has two children.

The contacts have been identified by interviewing the patient and doctor treating him. The doctor has been self-isolated as well.

This media briefing is to ensure that the public is immediately kept abreast. Local doctors have advised that frequent hand washing and limit large gatherings are a good way to control a potential spread of the virus. However, a press briefing by President Peach was held earlier were he claimed “Players town is the greatest town in the world, they have a huuuuge wall which keeps out all the China virus, with the best doctors and the best people - on all sides - and this is gonna take care of itself. Pandemic-shmandemic.”
Ultimately, the final decision on how to handle things locally is up to Mayor “Player-name”.

Dr Faucio Anthonio

Minister of Health
